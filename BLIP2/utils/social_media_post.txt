It’s family, not pets | The time you spent with me healed me
I still remember that when I first brought you home four years ago, your biological father and I complained more than once that you were "ugly". But as we spent more and more time together, watching you grow up, I began to like you in my heart. and love getting deeper and deeper
This video records the time you spent with me living alone in the past year
In the days to come, I hope you will still be a healthy and happy kitten

Dear baby. Today is the 100th day since you came into this world. We spent 100 days and nights together.
Watching you grow taller and fatter, your crying becomes smaller and smaller, and your smiles become more frequent.
You are my mother’s little angel, I always give my mother a silly smile when she is exhausted.
Your arrival make our lives more meaningful.
